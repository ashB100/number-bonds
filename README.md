============

NumberBonds is an app that helps children learn and remember combination of numbers that add up to a number so they
don't have to calculate them each time. 

##How it works.

###Players can choose to play: 
* **"Story of Numbers"**, which presents numbers between 2-10 as a stories and players have to enter every combination that adds up to that number. 

     Example:  
     **Story of Two** 

     0 + 2 = 2  
     
     1 + 1 = 2  
     
     2 + 0 = 2  
     
     
* **"Story of Doubles"** - players have to give the doubles of numbers between 0-20
* **"Story of Random Numbers"** - generates random numbers between 0-10 for players to add. 

Feedback is given to the player as to whether they got a calculaion correct.

A score is given in the end. 

The player is able to correct their answer, to encourage the players to learn through making mistakes.
